## 🚀 Why I Built UrbanWorth

As part of the **Stanford Summer Session**, I wanted to tackle a real-world regression problem that required not only predictive accuracy but also interpretability. UrbanWorth allowed me to deepen my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and feature engineering in R, while exploring the factors that influence real estate prices.

This project sharpened my ability to balance model complexity with explainability, which is crucial for practical applications like housing market analysis and investment decision-making.
